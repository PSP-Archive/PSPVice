VICE derives from X64, the first Commodore 64 emulator for the X Window
System.  Here is an informal list of the people who were mostly involved
in the development of X64 and VICE:

</P>
<P>
The VICE core team:

<UL>

<LI>

<B>Andreas Boose</B> gave lots of
information and bug reports about the VIC-II, the 6510 and the
CIAs; moreover, he wrote several test-routines that were used
to improve the emulation.  He also added cartridge support and
has been the main head behind the drive and datasette emulation
since version 0.15.  Also added several UI elements to the
MSDOS, MS-Windows and Unix ports. He rewrote the C128 emulation
adding Z80 mode, C64 mode and function ROM support, wrote the
screenshot and the event system and started the plus4 emulator.
Restructured the serial bus emulation and added realdrive and
rawdrive support.

engine and video hardware scaling.

console implementation for the built-in monitor, corrected some
REU related bugs, added support for the TFE and RR-Net

<LI>

<B>Markus Brenner</B> added VDC emulation to x128

and 256K memory expansions code. Wrote the pet REU code. Wrote
the plus4 memory expansions code. Made the ethernet support for
the Msdos port. Maintains the RiscOS, QNX 6.x, Solaris, GP2X,
Minix 3.x, Amiga, ppc-BeOS and newly resurrected OS/2 binary
ports. Added new .crt support. Added new screenshot formats.
Added new sound recording support. Added SIDcart support for
pet, plus4 and vic20. Added digimax support. Improved the MMC64
emulation. Added 2 MHz mode to x128. And lots of other fixes and
improvements.

<LI>

<B>Christian Vogelgsang</B> maintains the Mac OS X port. Added Intel Mac
support and universal binary creation. Wrote the build scripts for
all external Mac libraries and the bindist bundle tool. Improved
the TFE chip emulation. Added some Gtk+ fixes.
