<H1><A NAME="SEC136" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC136">9  Monitor</A></H1>

<P>
Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be used
to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as
well as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using
the "Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that you
have to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as
<CODE>rxvt</CODE> or <CODE>xterm</CODE>) in order to use the monitor.

</P>
<P>
<B>Warning</B>: this version of the monitor is still under construction,
and some of the features are not fully working yet.

<H2><A NAME="SEC137" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC137">9.1  Terminology</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`address_space'</SAMP>
<DD>
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of registers.
This can be the addresses available to the computer's processor, the
disk drive's processor or a specific memory configuration of one of
the mentioned processors.

<DT><SAMP>`bankname'</SAMP>
<DD>
The CPU can only see 64k of memory at any one time, due to its 16 bit
address bus. The C64 and other computers have more than this amount,
and this is handled by banking: a memory address can have different
contents, depending on the active memory bank. 
A bankname names a specific bank in the current address_space.

<DT><SAMP>`register'</SAMP>
<DD>
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

<DT><SAMP>`address'</SAMP>
<DD>
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

<DT><SAMP>`address_range'</SAMP>
<DD>
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both addresses
must be in the same address space.

<DT><SAMP>`address_opt_range'</SAMP>
<DD>
An address or an address range.

<DT><SAMP>`prompt'</SAMP>
<DD>
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second part
of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

<DT><SAMP>`checkpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an action
when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types of
checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

<DT><SAMP>`breakpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
triggered, the monitor is entered.

<DT><SAMP>`tracepoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

<DT><SAMP>`watchpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.  When
a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

<DT><SAMP>`&#60;...&#62;'</SAMP>
<DD>
A data type.

<DT><SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
<DD>
Zero or more occurrences.

<DT><SAMP>`[...]'</SAMP>
<DD>
An optional argument.

</DL>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>goto &#60;address&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Change the PC to address and continue execution.

<DT><CODE>io</CODE>
<DD>
Nothing yet.  Will display VIC/VIA/CIA/SID registers.

<DT><CODE>next [&#60;count&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as a single
instruction.

values.

<DT><CODE>return</CODE>
<DD>
Continues execution  and returns to the monitor just
after the next RTS or RTI is executed.

<DT><CODE>step [&#60;count&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows stepping
more than a single instruction at a time.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC139" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC139">9.3  Memory commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>bank [&#60;bankname&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Without a bankname, display all available banks for the current
address_space. With a bankname given, switch to the specified
bank. If a bank is not completely filled (ROM banks for example)
normally the <CODE>ram</CODE> bank is used where the bank has holes.
The <CODE>cpu</CODE> bank uses the bank currently used by the CPU.

<DT><CODE>compare &#60;address_range&#62; &#60;address&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to the
destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.  Any
values that miscompare are displayed using the default displaytype.

<DT><CODE>device [c:|8:|9:]</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default address space to either the computer `c:' or the
specified drive `8:' or `9:'
<DT><CODE>fill &#60;address_range&#62; &#60;data_list&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
&#60;data_list&#62;.  If the size of the address range is greater than the
size of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

<DT><CODE>hunt &#60;address_range&#62; &#60;data_list&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
&#60;data_list&#62;.  If the data is found, the starting address of the match
is displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible matches.

<DT><CODE>i &#60;address_opt_range&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

<DT><CODE>m [&#60;data_type&#62;] [&#60;address_opt_range&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the default
is used.  If only one address is specified, the length of data
displayed is based on the datatype.  If no addresses are given, the
'dot' address is used.

<DT><CODE>mc [&#60;data_type&#62;] [&#60;address_opt_range&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one address
is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no addresses are
given, the "dot" address is used.

<DT><CODE>ms [&#60;data_type&#62;] [&#60;address_opt_range&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one address is
specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no addresses are given,
the "dot" address is used.

<DT><CODE>move &#60;address_range&#62; &#60;address&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Move memory from the source specified by the address range to the
destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

<DT><CODE>sidefx [on|off|toggle]</CODE>
<DD>
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that have
read side-effects, like CIA interrupt registers for example.  
If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'off' then reads don't cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'toggle' then the current mode is switched.  No argument
displays the current state.

<DT><CODE>&#62; [&#60;address&#62;] &#60;data_list&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Write the specified data at <CODE>address</CODE>.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC140" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC140">9.4  Assembly commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>a &#60;address&#62; [ &#60;instruction&#62; [: &#60;instruction&#62;]* ]</CODE>
<DD>
Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line to
exit assembly mode).

<DT><CODE>d [&#60;address&#62; [&#60;address&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they are
used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it is
treated as the start address and a default number of instructions are
disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a default number of
instructions are disassembled from the dot address.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC141" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC141">9.5  Checkpoint commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>break [&#60;address&#62; [if &#60;cond_expr&#62;] ]</CODE>
<DD>
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid checkpoints
are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is set for that
address and the breakpoint number is printed.  A conditional
expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.  For more
information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

<DT><CODE>enable &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>disable &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
changing between these states.

<DT><CODE>command &#60;checknum&#62; "&#60;command&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
When checkpoint <CODE>checknum</CODE> is hit, the specified command is
executed by the monitor.  Note that the <CODE>x</CODE> command is not yet
supported as a command argument.

<DT><CODE>condition &#60;checknum&#62; if &#60;cond_expr&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignores.  If registers are specified in the
expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint is
examined, not when the condition is set.

<DT><CODE>delete &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Delete the specified checkpoint.

<DT><CODE>ignore &#60;checknum&#62; [&#60;count&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore a checkpoint after a given number of crossings.  If no count is
given, the default value is 1.

<DT><CODE>trace [address [address]]</CODE>
<DD>
This command is similar to the <CODE>break</CODE> command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint by
not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the user an
execution trace.  The second optional address can be used to specify
the end of an range of addresses to be traced.

<DT><CODE>watch [loadstore] [address [address]]</CODE>
<DD>
This command is similar to the previous two commands except that it
operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from the others by
stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of addresses.
If no addresses are given, a list of all the watchpoints is printed.
The loadstore parameter can be either "load" or "store" to determine
on which operation the monitor breaks. If not specified, the monitor
breaks on both operations.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC142" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC142">9.6  General commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>cd &#60;directory&#62;</CODE>

<DD>
Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
argument, the current radix is printed.

<DT><CODE>sidefx [on|off|toggle]</CODE>
<DD>
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that have
read side-effects.  If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause
side-effects.  If the argument is 'off' then reads don't cause
side-effects.  If the argument is 'toggle' then the current mode is
switched.  No argument displays the current state.

<DT><CODE>system &#60;system command&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Nothing yet.

<DT><CODE>load "&#60;filename&#62;" &#60;device&#62; [&#60;address&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Load the specified file into memory.  If no address is given, the file
is loaded to the address specified by the first two bytes read from
the file.  If address is given, the file is loaded to the specified
address and the first two bytes read from the file are skipped.  If
device is 0, the file is read from the file system.

<DT><CODE>save "&#60;filename&#62;" &#60;device&#62; &#60;address1&#62; &#60;address2&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.  If
device is 0, the file is written to the file system.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC144" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC144">9.8  Command file commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>playback "&#60;filename&#62;"</CODE>

assembly code and is shown during disassembly.

<DT><CODE>delete_label [&#60;memspace&#62;] &#60;label&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no memory space is
checked, all tables are checked.

<DT><CODE>load_labels [&#60;memspace&#62;] "&#60;filename&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
