// --------------------------------
// FONT PACKAGE (C format)
// consolecoder@hotmail.com 
//
// Here is a package of 44 nice 8x8 fonts, very usefull for GBA coding.
//
// Format of this font : 8x8 pixel, 1 color, 96 caracters.
// Each byte represent   8 pixels, each 8 bytes row represents 1 caracter.
//
// The caracter order is the same as ASCII table.
// The first caracter of this set correspond to ASCII caracter 32 (space).
//
// To find the index of caracter c, just do : (c-32)*8
// The fastest way to use this font "as it is", is to precalc a 256 entry table
// making the link between a byte and the 8 pixel issued from that byte.
//
// Fonts ripped from "POWER FONTS" (Amiga) by Kefrens (I think)
// Most of them are well known C64 fonts.
// Orignial name : "Pinochio.fnt"
